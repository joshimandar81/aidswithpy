11) Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code. Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once. 
    An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time to execute the process is much slower.Interpreter is used in python language.

12) PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. 
    For most installations, you should not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run. Python knows where to find its standard library.

13) Python String strip() unction will remove leading and trailing whitespaces. If you want to remove only leading or trailing spaces, use lstrip() or rstrip() function instead.

15) num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    # initialize sum
    sum = 0

    # find the sum of the cube of each digit
      temp = num
while temp > 0:
   digit = temp % 10
   sum += digit ** 3
   temp //= 10

# display the result
if num == sum:
   print(num,"is an Armstrong number")
else:
   print(num,"is not an Armstrong number")

12) the formulae for r square is = 1 - RSE
    where , RSE = REsidual Standard Error
    where RSE can be calculated by 

            RSE = sum of (y1 - y2)^2 / sum of (y1 - y3)^2
               where, y1 = actual values
                      y2 = predicted values
                      y1 - y3  = Degree of Freedom

   R sqaure method is used to find out the fiiting of train values.
   If R sqaure value is high which means that best fitting model.

13) It is a function that measures the performance of a Machine Learning model for given data. 
    Cost Function quantifies the error between predicted values and expected values and presents it in the form of a single real number.
    Depending on the problem Cost Function can be formed in many different ways.

14) SST is the maximum sum of squares of errors for the data because the minimum information of Y itself was only used for the baseline model.
    The difference between SST and SSR is remaining unexplained variability of Y after adopting the regression model, which is called as sum of squares of errors (SSE).
    A relatively small SSE can be interpreted as a “good fit” of the model. The usefulness of the regression model is tested using F test as a global evaluation of the regression model.

15) The various metrics used to evaluate the results of the prediction are : Mean Squared Error(MSE) Root-Mean-Squared-Error(RMSE). Mean-Absolute-Error(MAE)
    
    MSE = 1/n sum of (y1-y2)^2

    RMSE = 1/n sum of root of (y1-y2)^2

    MAE = 1/n sum of determinent of y1 - y2

    Where , y1 = actual values
            y2 = Predicted values
